## Inspiration
Games have been forever vital to our group members. In our perspective, a potential designed game can end up teaching you bunch of things such as multitasking, concentration building. Moreover if its a educational game it would be a cherry on the cake. So, we thought why to just play games when as aspiring developers , we can create them. 

## What it does
Rescue shark is an adventurous educational game as we promote non violent games, which is instilling a negative mental impact on
the younger generation as such, where Sharkie, our protagonist, is out there to save her friend sharko which has a limited survival time. And each level ends up with some unique interesting facts about the sharkie-sharko community ,i.e., sharks. Lets figure out will sharkie will be able to help her friend or end up succumbing to the obstacles?

## How we built it
We built it using the latest 2020 version of Unity and Blender and photoshop for the animations and sprites. 

## Challenges we ran into
Deciding to build a game and then implementing it was a totally different task altogether, we brainstormed creating the sprites and the animations. The scene creation for various levels also consumed time. A lot of time was invested in fixing the bugs of our code

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We were finally able to build this combining all the components and spending various hours on blender and photoshop. We are managed to create a meaningful educational game in time.

## What we learned
We learnt how to make a 2d platform game in Unity. How does sprites ,animator and animation are carried out. We learnt many concepts of C# programming too.

## What's next for Shark Rescue
We are planning to introduce various AI operated enemies to our levels to make it even more thrilling and then we will launch it.
